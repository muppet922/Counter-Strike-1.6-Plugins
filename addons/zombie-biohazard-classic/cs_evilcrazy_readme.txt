Plot:

This part of the forest used to be a gathering spot for the witches and shamans. But in the 50's, a wealthy man known as Mr Alfred Evler, to whom this land belonged, made plans to build a manor. The locals didn't like this and thay tried to stop him but he went ahead with his plans. Depressed, the witches blew a curse on him stating that he and his family will die in a period of eight years. True to their word, Mr alfred and his wife Eva along with their five children all died in a period of eight years although the nature of their death is still a mystery even to this day.

Some decades later, a wealthy british millionaire bought this manor. Being impressed with the gothic architecture, he ordered a complete restoration of the house. But the local workman refused to cooperated with him and the locals warned him and told him that the devil himself dwells there. The millionaire abandoned the manor soon after. 

Even to this date, ghost hunters and demon hunters frequent this house. In 2011, a group of young people, did a sneak out on halloween night and came to this house, unbeknown of its frightful history. To make things worse, a group of terrorist were staking out this house, planning to cause a major mayhem later this week. They changed their plans after discovering the frightful nature of the house but just when thay started to pack up, the counter-terrorist showed up at the door lookin for the four boys.

Pretty soon, mayhem erupts and the souls which were stored in the house for years were wakened by the disturbance.
