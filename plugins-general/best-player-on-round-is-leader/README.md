This amxmodx plugin inspire players to be the best each round. The one who was the best gets a skin and position of a leader and has to keep playing good in order to mantain it.

To take the leadership will have to sweat, there are two modes how to do it:
The first is to kill more players than the previous leader. 
The second mode is used in case if the kills are the same, he counts the amount of damage inflicted and gives the leadership to the one who caused it more.

Speaking of models, if a player gets the leaderboard, he gets an identical model of the class he chose before, just with the leaderboard inscription. Also, you can make several models for one player's class, in which case the model will be chosen at random. In the archive are all 8 types of models, if the desire and ability to work with models you can replace them with their own.
